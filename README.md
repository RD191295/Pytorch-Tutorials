# Pytorch
PyTorch is an open-source library used in machine learning library developed using Torch library for python program. It is developed by Facebookâ€™s AI Research lab and released in January 2016 as a free and open-source library mainly used in computer vision, deep learning, and natural language processing applications. Programmer can build a complex neural network with ease using PyTorch as it has a core data structure, Tensor, multi-dimensional array like Numpy arrays. PyTorch use is increasing in current industries and in the research community as it is flexible, faster, easy to get the project up and running, due to which PyTorch is one of the top deep learning tools.
